# quiz_tickleYourMind


## Description

This is a small, ten question quiz about JavaScript fundamentals. When the page loads, the user can look at a high scores page (if any scores exist) or start the quiz. If no high scores exist yet but the user clicks the high scores button, a message will suggest they play the game to save some scores. Upon finishing the quiz, the user is prompted to submit their initials to save their score to localStorage, where it will be pulled and output on the DOM as a High Score display.

## Credits

The questions and answers were generated with ChatGPT using a format JD walked us through in class. The prompt is in questions.js, in case it needs to be seen.

JD provided us with examples of each of the concepts we applied to this assignment. I referenced the work we did in class at the start of the assignment to get started.
